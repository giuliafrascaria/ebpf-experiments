# Build bpf code (kernel) out-of-tree by referencing local copies of
# bpf .h files along with headers from kernel source tree.
# Creates similar environment to that used by samples/bpf by adding
# ../include/[bpf_endian.h,bpf_helpers.h,linux/types.h]. The latter is
# used to get definitions for u64, u32 etc which are needed by other kernel
# headers.

# Assumptions:

#
# - llc/clang are available and support "bpf" target; check with "llc --verison"
